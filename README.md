## Getting Started / Uses
---
Here's a few really simple commands for you to get started.

You can replace `sloth <args>` with `cargo run --release -- <args>` anywhere

#### Render pikachu
```
sloth models/Pikachu.obj
```
#### For multiple models:   
```
sloth "models/suzy.obj models/suzy.obj"
```
#### You can also generate a static image:
```
sloth models/Pikachu.obj image -w <width_in_pixels> -h <height_in_pixels>
```
#### You can also generate a portable Javascript render like this:
```
sloth models/Pikachu.obj image -j <number_of_frames> -w <width_in_pixels> -h <height_in_pixels> > src-webify/data.js
```
